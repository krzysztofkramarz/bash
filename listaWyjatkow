 ConcurrentModificationException - gdy tworzymy iterator na liście a potem zmieniamy kolekcję. 
It is not generally permissible for one thread to modify a Collection while another thread is iterating over it. Iterators that do this are known as fail-fast iterators, as they fail quickly and cleanly, rather that risking arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined time in the future.
